								<h2>About us</h2>
								<p>Ágoston Weisz and László Nikházy have been tutoring talented students for more than 10 years. Ágoston has been working for 5 years for Google in Zurich, his current role is senior software engineer. Laci, who has organized several math camps with the Joy of Thinking foundation now works on creating such camps on the topic of programming as well.</p>
								<p>Many of their former and current students have achieved great results at national and international olympiads in mathematics (IMO, MEMO, EGMO, OKTV). However, this programme is not about (or not entirely about) preparing for competitions. Our main goal spreading the joy of programming and teamwork. We welcome those students too, who are not planning on attending a single mathematics competition in their life.</p>
								<p>It is of utmost importance that every motivated child has access to the best educations, regardless of gender, age or place of living. It is also important to teach them that using a computer does not mean playing games, rather it is something, that allows us to solve problems, become smarter and create something, that has an impact on the world.</p>
								<h2>About the programme</h2>
								<p>We teach mathematics in a system based mainly upon online individual and teamwork. We hold biweekly classes for students. Besides classes, we provide students with problems with hints, that they can solve in their own pace. We also teach them how to find problems and resources to master new concepts and put their theoretical knowledge in practice on their own. Students can ask questions or ask for help outside classes too. We host online board game nights, which students can earn by obtaining points for their solutions for problems.</p>
								<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
								<p>Students who attend grade four to six can participate in the programme. We are looking for motivated, curious children, who are not afraid to ask questions. Special talent is not a requirement, but the programme will benefit those the most who enjoy thinking about mathematical problems.
								</p>
								<h2>What do we offer?</h2>
								<p>By taking part in the programme, students have the opportunity to learn analytical thinking and problem solving. They learn that a team can achieve more than any individual, they learn to cooperate with others and to motivate and support them. They also learn how to overcome challenges and obstacles, they experience the joy of success through solving harder problems.</p>
								<h2>Financial matters</h2>
								<p>Participation is 100 USD per month.</p>
